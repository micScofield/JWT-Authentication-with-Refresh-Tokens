1. There is an endpoint for token refresh.
2. Storing access token in a httpOnly cookie and refresh token in local storage.
3. For each request, the access token must be present, if it is invalid, we send back a 401, in frontend, the refresh token endpoint must be targeted with a valid refresh token. On server, auth middleware checks for access token. If access token is invalid, we pass the request and user is not set on req.user. And whatever APIs require authentication will fail, thanks to requireAuth middleware.
